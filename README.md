# 📊 Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment Analysis

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project explores how **market sentiment** — categorized as *Fear*, *Greed*, *Extreme Fear*, *Extreme Greed*, and *Neutral* — impacts **trader performance** and **trading behavior**.  
By analyzing profit/loss (`ClosedPnL`), trade sizes, and trading sides (BUY/SELL), this project uncovers behavioral patterns that reveal how emotions influence market activity.

---

## 🎯 Objective
> To explore the relationship between trader performance and market sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver insights that can drive smarter trading strategies.

## 📊 Key Insights Summary

| Topic | Observation |
|-------|--------------|
| **Trader Behavior** | Most trades occur during *Fear* and *Greed* phases — emotional markets drive participation. |
| **Profitability** | *Extreme Greed* yields highest average profits, while *Extreme Fear* shows lowest returns. |
| **Trade Size** | Majority of trades are small, reflecting cautious trading; few large trades indicate institutional activity. |
| **Sentiment Impact** | Trader performance improves with market optimism but also shows higher volatility. |
| **Correlations** | Weak correlation between `closed_pnl` and numeric variables → profitability is sentiment-driven, not numeric. |

---

## 🧠 Insights Summary

- **Trader performance peaks in Greed phases** when confidence is high.  
- **Fear phases** show smaller trades and lower profit, reflecting defensive trading.  
- **Extreme Greed** brings high potential profits but increased risk and variability.  
- **Market sentiment strongly drives trading volume, exposure, and performance.**

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Develop **sentiment-aware trading systems** that adjust strategies dynamically based on Fear-Greed indices.  
- Implement **risk controls during Extreme Fear** phases to prevent panic selling.  
- Use **position-size caps** during Greed phases to mitigate overexposure.  
- Combine historical trade data with sentiment signals to improve forecasting models.
